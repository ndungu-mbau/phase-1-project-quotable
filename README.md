# Phase 1 Project - Quotable

## Overview

Quotable is a simple quotes application that allows you to view random quotes. It also allows you to like or unlike quotes. You can also view your liked quotes.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the server, run the following commands:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

```bash
live-server --port=5000 --host=0.0.0.0
```

This will launch both json-server and live-server in the background. You can then navigate to http://localhost:5000 to view the quotes.
